## 2025-12-15 - SQL Injection in Tours API
**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection in `src/routes/tours.js` (`getWrapper` and `totalWrapper`) due to string interpolation in `knex.raw`.
**Learning:** `knex.raw` does not automatically sanitize template literals. Dynamic query construction for `UNION` and `WHERE` clauses requires careful binding management.
**Prevention:** Always use parameterized queries (`?`) and pass bindings array to `knex.raw`. Validate input where possible.

## 2025-12-17 - Additional SQL Injection in Tours Connections
**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection in `src/routes/tours.js` (`connectionsExtendedWrapper`) due to string interpolation of `id` and `city` in `knex.raw`.
**Learning:** The pattern of using template literals in `knex.raw` was pervasive. Input validation for `req.params` was also missing.
**Prevention:** Audit all `knex.raw` usages. Enforce parameterization and type checking (e.g., `parseInt`).

## 2025-02-12 - SQL Injection in Search/Filter
**Vulnerability:** Extensive SQL injection in `src/routes/tours.js` (`listWrapper` and `filterWrapper`) via dynamic construction of `WHERE` clauses using string interpolation for `city`, `filter`, and search parameters.
**Learning:** Legacy code used complex string concatenation for dynamic queries, making parameterization difficult. The `filter` parameter (JSON string) was particularly dangerous as it was parsed and values interpolated.
**Prevention:** Refactored dynamic query construction to use a structured approach (parts with SQL and bindings) ensuring all user inputs are passed as parameters to `knex.raw`.
